/// Keeps the app's two local notices (spec section 7.2) in step with the person, on the phone:
///
///  * **"Hoy vence…"** is scheduled for 9:00 in the profile's zone only while someone is signed in,
///    its switch is on, they have a recurring payment still running **and** notifications are
///    allowed (a guest included); otherwise it is cancelled, so the phone never wakes up, nor
///    asks the server anything, for a notice that cannot be posted. Offline, with nothing known,
///    the job is left as it is.
///  * **The guest warning** is set 45 days ahead, again at every opening of the app on a guest
///    account **that the server accepted a request from** (that is when its own 60-day clock
///    restarts; an opening offline leaves the job as it was), and cancelled when the account
///    stops being a guest (a claimed email, a sign-out) or its switch goes off.
///  * **The notification permission** (Android 13+) is asked in the app, with one sentence on why,
///    the first time a notice is relevant while the app is open: a recurring payment and the due
///    switch on, or a guest account and the guest switch on. It is asked once, whatever the
///    answer: a refusal only means the notices are not posted.
///
/// Runs one pass at a time; a pass is asked for at the start, whenever the session, a switch or the
/// language changes, and whenever the app comes back to the foreground (that is an opening too).
/// Where there is no Android side ([NoticePermission.unavailable]) it does nothing at all.
