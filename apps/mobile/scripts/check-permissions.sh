# Checks the permissions the release APK asks for, with `aapt2 dump permissions`.
#
# The release build is what F-Droid ships, and Android merges the INTERNET permission into debug
# and profile builds only (src/debug, src/profile), so a release APK without it cannot reach its
# server. This fails when INTERNET, RECORD_AUDIO (quick capture's microphone, Task 12), VIBRATE
# (the haptics, Task 13), ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE or RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED (the widget's refresh job
# on WorkManager, Task 15) or POST_NOTIFICATIONS (the two local notices, Task 16) is missing, and when the APK asks for any permission not in ALLOWED
# below: a new permission is a decision, made here on purpose.
#
# Usage, from anywhere (after `flutter build apk --release`):
#   apps/mobile/scripts/check-permissions.sh [--apk <path>]
#   apps/mobile/scripts/check-permissions.sh --dump <file>   a recorded dump (the tests use it)
# Exit codes: 0 as expected, 1 missing or unexpected permission, 2 no APK, aapt2 or dump.
