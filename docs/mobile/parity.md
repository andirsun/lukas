# Parity: the app against the web, picture by picture

Stage 3b's rule is that the app looks like the web (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-23-stage-3b-mobile-parity-design.md`, §4 and §5). The parity
harness checks it. Each **pair** is a web Storybook story in one theme and an app test that
renders the same thing as a golden, at the same size, from the same data. A review picture puts
the two side by side, with the pixels that differ marked.

## The loop

From the repository root (Flutter on PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/development/flutter/bin:$PATH"`):

```sh
pnpm --filter @lukas/web parity:fixtures        # the stories' data → apps/mobile/test/parity/fixtures
pnpm --filter @lukas/web parity:shots           # the stories' pictures → apps/mobile/test/parity/web
cd apps/mobile
flutter test --update-goldens test/parity       # the app's pictures → test/parity/app
dart run tool/parity/compose.dart --max 2       # side by side → build/parity; fails over 2% of ink
```

Each command takes an optional id filter, e.g. `parity:shots money` or `compose.dart money`.

Then open `apps/mobile/build/parity/<id>-<theme>.png`:

- top left: the web;
- top right: the app;
- underneath: the web in grey, with every differing pixel in magenta, and the two shares below.

### What differs, and the pass rule

- **A pixel differs** when its colour on one side is nowhere within one logical pixel (two physical
  pixels, at the parity's ratio of 2) of the same place on the other side. Colours count as the
  same within 24 of 255 per channel.
  - That forgives what spec §5 allows: antialiasing, and text that Chrome and Flutter round to
    different pixels (see "Known differences").
  - It does not forgive a wrong size, weight, colour or spacing.
- **The ink share** is the measure: differing pixels over the pixels that are not the page's
  background on either side. The share of the whole page is printed too, but a small component on
  an empty page is almost all background, so that number says little.
- **A pair passes** when:
  - the picture shows no visible difference except those spec §5 allows: the system bars, the 🎤
    next to the ＋, the web-only demo banner, and text antialiasing; and
  - **under 2% of its ink differs.** `compose.dart --max 2` exits non-zero when a pair is over.
- Look at the picture first. The number backs it up; it does not replace it.

How the rule was set, on Money (compose's unit tests pin the tolerances):

| | Ink that differs |
| --- | --- |
| The true Money pairs | 0.00% on all 7 |
| Probe: Money's colour at 85% alpha | 64% to 85% (all 7 over) |
| Probe: Money's font 1 px bigger | 26% to 35% (all 7 over) |
| A tolerance of ±1 physical pixel instead, true pairs | 20–22% for the hero amount |

The last row is why the shift tolerance is a logical pixel, not a physical one. Blink rounds line
metrics to whole CSS pixels, so the hero amount sits 2 physical pixels away. With ±1 physical
pixel, the true pair would fail the 2% rule.

`compose.dart` writes both shares for every pair to `build/parity/summary.json`.

Once the app's side is right, plain `flutter test test/parity` is the regression test: it fails
when the app's picture changes. The web shots are regenerated only when the web changes.

## Adding a pair

1. Add the pair to `apps/mobile/test/parity/parity.json`, once per theme:

   ```json
   { "id": "money-spanish", "storyId": "ui-money--spanish", "theme": "night",
     "appTest": "test/parity/money_parity_test.dart" }
   ```

   - `id` is the file stem: `web/<id>-<theme>.png` and `app/<id>-<theme>.png`.
   - `storyId` is the Storybook id, as in the URL's `?id=`.
   - Every shared screen and component has a pair in `night` and in `day`. A story that pins
     `globals: { theme: "day" }` only has a day pair; the shots script refuses the other one.

2. Write the app test first, so it fails before the widget exists. Mark the file
   `@Tags(['golden'])` and call:

   ```dart
   await parityGolden(t, 'money-spanish', screen, theme: 'night');
   ```

   - Pass `locale: const Locale('en')` for a story with `globals: { locale: "en" }`.
   - A component's story goes in `ParityStoryFrame`, which is what Storybook's decorator puts
     around it: the page background, 16px padding, and the body's text as the line it sits on.
   - A story whose root is a block (a `div`: a flex column, a grid, a `max-w` box) is not an inline element on
     the body's line: pass `ParityStoryFrame(block: true, ...)`, and make the box as a CSS block is
     with `cssBlock(maxWidth: ...)`, `lkPad` and `lkRowFlex` (`.lk-pad`, `.lk-row-flex`).
   - A full-screen story (`layout: "fullscreen"`, its own screen) is passed as is.

   A story's `play` function leaves the page in a state (a focus ring after `userEvent.click`, a
   month stepped back, a button held with `is-pressed`). Pass `act:` to `parityGolden` to do the same
   in the app, with real taps, keys and held fingers: `t.sendKeyEvent(LogicalKeyboardKey.tab)`
   puts the app in keyboard mode, where the focused control draws its ring, as the story's click
   does in Chrome (`userEvent` focuses from script, which counts as keyboard). Do the taps first and
   the keys last: a tap puts the app back in touch mode, where no ring shows.

3. Read the story's data from its fixture: `ParityFixtures.load(storyId)`.
   - `fixture.get('/v1/summary?month=2026-10').body` is the JSON the story's fake API answered.
   - `fixture.now` is the clock the story ran at. `parityGolden` pins the app's `clockProvider`
     to it.

4. Run the loop, look at the picture, and fix the app until the picture shows no visible
   difference and `compose.dart --max 2` passes. Commit the web shot, the fixture and the golden.
   `build/parity` stays out of git.

## How the two sides are made the same

- **Size.** 412 × 915 logical pixels at a device pixel ratio of 2, so both pictures are 824 × 1830.
  On the web it is the Playwright viewport. In the app it is the test view.
- **Clock.** Both sides use the e2e suite's "now", 21 October 2026 at 15:00 UTC (`E2E_NOW`), in
  Europe/Madrid.
  - The shots and the fixtures pin the page's clock before anything loads, with the demo stories'
    own `fakeClock` (`apps/web/app/demo/fake-clock.ts`). The stories' "today" and month (for example
    `STORY_TODAY`) therefore come out the same on any real date.
  - The fixture records that time, and `parityGolden` gives it to the app.
- **Data.** A story harness hands its fake `fetch` to `exposeStoryFetch`
  (`apps/web/.storybook/parity.ts`). `HomeStage`, the demo's `DemoStage` and `SignInStage` do. A
  harness for a new kind of screen does the same.
  - `parity:fixtures` opens the story and lets it render and play.
  - Then it asks that same fake API every GET the story made, plus the app's GETs (`APP_GETS` in
    `apps/web/scripts/parity-fixtures.ts`).
  - When a screen needs a GET that is not there, add it to `APP_GETS`.
  - Keys are the API path without the web's `/api` mount, with the query sorted:
    `GET /v1/transactions?limit=50&month=2026-10`.
  - A component's story has no fake API, so its fixture has only the clock.
- **Theme.** The shots open `iframe.html?id=<story>&globals=theme:<theme>`, which is what the
  toolbar's theme does (`.storybook/preview.tsx`). The app test uses the app's `nightTheme` or
  `dayTheme`.
- **Settling.**
  - The shots wait for Storybook's "finished" phase, after the story has rendered, played and
    finished its animations.
  - Then they take pictures until two in a row are identical. CSS animations are taken at rest:
    finite ones at their end, endless ones (Lukitas' sprite) at their first frame.
  - The app test uses `pumpAndSettle`.
- **Fonts.** Both sides draw Fredoka and Nunito, from the web's `@fontsource` files and from the
  app's bundled upstream files.
- **Emoji.** Both sides draw emoji with Noto Color Emoji (SIL OFL 1.1). The font is committed
  unmodified in `apps/mobile/test/parity/fonts` with its licence. It is test-only and never goes
  into the APK.
  - The shots add it to each of the page's font faces, for the emoji code points only. Chrome then
    draws it instead of the Mac's Apple Color Emoji.
  - The font keeps its pictures as PNGs in `CBDT` tables. `flutter test` on macOS draws through Core
    Text, which only draws Apple's `sbix` tables. So `test/support/emoji_font.dart` moves the same
    PNGs into an `sbix` table, in memory, for the goldens.
  - The file is googlefonts/noto-emoji's `2D/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf` (the CBDT build, version
    2.057, Emoji 18), unmodified and not subset:
    - source commit `e20cbc2bbec1926686be9f9bee7d1d2cfa1fea0e` (the font last changed in
      `1ffdd21391dd`, "Add Emoji 18 fonts");
    - SHA-256 `15671215ab769fdc7162a045d56fd7d7e477c51b04e6b3c761d914d8fdd6cc44`, 10,730,124 bytes;
    - `NotoColorEmoji-OFL.txt` is that commit's `2D/fonts/LICENSE`.
  - It is test-only. Nothing in pubspec.yaml names it, and the release APK's assets hold only
    Fredoka, Nunito and the tree-shaken Material icons.
  - To update it, replace both files from a newer commit, record the commit and SHA-256 here, and
    run the loop. Take the CBDT `NotoColorEmoji.ttf`, not a COLRv1 build: `sbixFromCbdt` reads CBDT.
  - `test/parity/emoji_font_test.dart` checks that `sbixFromCbdt` converts the committed file. It
    also fails when an emoji in any fixture, or anywhere in the web's and the app's code, has no
    picture in it, so a missing emoji is reported rather than drawn as a box.
- **Randomness.** Home's Lukitas picks one of three phrasings of a line at random. The shots pin
  `Math.random` to 0 (`RANDOM_SCRIPT` in `apps/web/scripts/parity-storybook.ts`), so every picture shows
  the first phrasing, and the home pairs ask the app for it too (`lukasVariantProvider`).
- **The story's page.** Storybook pads every story by 16px (`.storybook/preview.tsx`) while the bottom bar
  stays fixed to the viewport, and the web's background gradient is as tall as its page (a long list
  stretches it, and `min-h-dvh` keeps a short page a screen tall) and scrolls away with it. A screen pair puts
  the app's screen in a `ShellFrame` (`lib/ui/app_shell.dart`) with that padding (which the screen puts inside its
  scroll content, `ShellRoom.leading` and `ShellRoom.sides`, so it scrolls as Storybook's does), no 🎤 (`showMic`)
  and, for the demo, a stand-in of the banner (`banner`). The gradient is the app's own, in the app and in the
  pairs: the shell paints it as tall as its screen's scroll content (at least the screen) and moves it with
  the scrolling (`PageGradientPainter`, from the scroll notifications). In the app itself the frame is zero.
- **Stories that end with a sheet open.** `home-home--empty-month` opens the add sheet and closes it again
  (the story's play function was changed to close it), so its picture is the empty month. The add sheet has
  its own pairs (Task 8).
- **Shadows.** `flutter test` draws every shadow hard-edged, to keep goldens from flaking. The web's
  glow under a primary button is a 24px blur, so `parityGolden` turns `debugDisableShadows` off for
  the picture and back on before the test ends.
- **The ✓ of "Pagado".** Nunito has no ✓. Chrome on the Mac falls back to Zapf Dingbats (found with
  CDP's `CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode`) and thickens it, because the badge asks for weight 900 and that
  font has one. Flutter's tests thicken nothing. So both sides draw U+2713 from the Mac's own
  `/System/Library/Fonts/ZapfDingbats.ttf`, at the face's own weight (`useParityEmoji`,
  `loadParityFonts`). It is Apple's, so it is read from the Mac, never committed. On a phone, Android's
  fallback font draws it, and thickens it in both Chrome and Flutter.
- **⌫ and ＋.** No web font has them, so Chrome on the Mac falls back: ⌫ (the keypad's backspace) to San
  Francisco (`.SF NS`, because the stacks end in `ui-rounded, system-ui`), ＋ (the bottom bar's add button)
  to PingFang SC Semibold (found with CDP's `CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode`). `flutter test` has no
  fallback, so the golden harness names the same system files: `/System/Library/Fonts/SFNS.ttf`, and the
  `PingFang.ttc` of macOS's downloaded font asset (face 11 is `PingFangSC-Semibold`, taken out of the
  collection by `ttcFace`). Apple's, read from the Mac, never committed. On a phone Android's fallback
  draws them.
- **✓ and ✎ are a known test-font difference** until NotoSansSymbols2 (OFL) is in the harness. Neither is in a
  web font, so Chrome falls back to a system font and the Flutter golden harness names macOS Zapf Dingbats
  (`test/support/emoji_font.dart`, `loadParityFonts`). For ✓ both sides use Zapf Dingbats (the shots read it
  from the Mac too); for ✎ Chrome picks another font than Zapf Dingbats, so the glyph differs visibly. A pair
  that draws one of them carries a `knownDifferences` note in `test/parity/parity.json`, and
  `compose.dart` prints it on the pair's line (`KNOWN DIFFERENCE: ...`) and writes it to `summary.json`: a
  pass there is not proof of that glyph. The pairs:
  - ✓: `pending-badge-idle-to-paid`, `pending-badge-day-english`, `transaction-row-pending`,
    `name-field-pick-shortcut`, `name-field-typing`, `name-field-day-english`.
  - ✎: `swipe-row-open-day-english` (the Editar action).
  Remove the notes when the symbol font replaces Zapf Dingbats on both sides.
- **Icons.** Material icons draw with the Flutter SDK's own `MaterialIcons-Regular.otf`
  (`loadMaterialIcons` in `test/support/fonts.dart`), the file `flutter build` bundles. The Stage 3
  goldens load it too.

## Known differences

- **Inline line boxes.** Blink rounds a font's ascent and descent to whole pixels and floors the
  half-leading. Flutter does neither.
  - `ParityStoryFrame` places its child on the body's line the way Blink does (`cssStrutAscent`).
  - A text style whose line height is smaller than its font's own (`.lk-hero-amount` at 1.05) still
    sits up to one logical pixel lower in the app than in Chrome.
  - That is within spec §5's one-pixel wobble. compose's one-logical-pixel tolerance forgives it.
- **Glyph rasterising.** Chrome and `flutter test` rasterise the same glyphs a little differently:
  edges differ by a physical pixel here and there, which the tolerance forgives too.
- **What the tolerance hides.** An element off by one logical pixel, such as padding of 15 instead
  of 16, is not counted. Two pixels or more is.
- **What Chrome does that Flutter does not.** `lib/ui` does these where a picture needs them (each
  is in the widget's code with the number that shows it):
  - Chrome lays a `1.5px` border out as 1px (the pending badge is 20.25px tall, not 21.25).
  - Chrome puts half of a letter spacing before a glyph and half after it, and Skia places glyphs on
    a quarter of a device pixel, so a text with a letter spacing sits a hair under a quarter pixel
    further right in Flutter's picture (`letterSpacingShift`). Without it a 9.5px label differs by 5%.
  - Chrome rounds a font's ascent and descent to whole pixels and floors the half-leading, so a line
    of text inside a taller line box sits up to a pixel higher or lower than Flutter's
    (`cssBaselineShift`, `BlinkLine`).
  - CSS clips a box shadow inside the box, Flutter paints it under the whole box: a see-through box
    with an edge (the pending badge) uses `OutsideShadow`.
  - CSS paints the first shadow of a list on top, Flutter the last: the brand button's edge and glow
    are reversed.
  - A multi-word text is laid out word by word (`CssText`): Blink shapes each word and each space on
    its own and keeps every width in 64ths of a pixel, rounded up, so a line is a hundredth or two
    wider than Flutter shapes it, and every word after the first starts a hair further right. A
    hundredth decides which quarter of a device pixel a glyph is drawn on, so a flowed row of
    pills (the name shortcuts) drifts off the web's picture unless it is laid out the same way.
    Flutter also rounds a laid-out text's width up to a whole pixel; `CssText` uses the exact one.
  - Chrome rounds the left, top, right and bottom of every box to whole device pixels when it paints
    it, and keeps the fractions for layout and for the text inside. `SnappedDecoratedBox` (used by
    `PressSurface`) paints a box that way, and `snappedColumns` lays out equal columns (the keypad's
    102.67px keys) with their edges on whole pixels, the text staying where the unrounded box puts it.
    Without it every fractional edge is anti-aliased across two pixels and counts as a difference.
  - Chrome adds line boxes up as CSS gives them (19.5px for one line of 13px at 1.5), while Flutter rounds every
    line up to whole pixels (20px), so a screen of such lines drifts further from the web's with each one.
    `CssLines` takes the rounding back for the lines home is made of (the hero, a day's heading, a row's
    status line).
  - Chrome paints a box's edges, and an outline's, on whole device pixels wherever the page's fractional
    lines put them: the hero card, the budget bar and the focus ring use `SnappedDecoratedBox`.
  - A dashed border is each straight side on its own, dashes three widths long and gaps two, from where
    Chrome starts each side (`_DashedBorder`, the nudge card).
  - A `Container` insets its child by its border; a `DecoratedBox` does not (a 2px border is padding
    in the web's box model, so add it).
  - A box that holds another focusable (a transaction row and its badge) is focused while the one
    inside is, but only the one that has the primary focus rings. And a ring that comes and goes must not
    change the tree around its child (it would rebuild the child's state): `RingBox` keeps one tree.
  - A row's 44px badge sits in a 20px line (`-my-3`): `OutsetBox` takes the room back, and
    `HitTargetBoost` lets a touch on the part outside the line still reach the badge, as a browser does
    for an overflowing element.
- **Category management stays on the web (founder ruling, Stage 3b).** Where the web's category detail has
  "Editar" (and "Restaurar" on an archived one), the app has a link to the web, "Más en la web". The detail's
  pairs (`category-detail`, `budget-sheet`, `budget-sheet-negative`) draw it with the web's word through
  `CategoryDetailScreen.manageLabel`, so everything else is compared; the box is the same (`PressLink`, secondary,
  small). The real label is `settingsWeb`. There is no way to clear a budget: the web's sheet refuses zero and the
  API has no delete, so the app has none either. The budget sheet's stories `manage-categories--budget-sheet-open`
  and `--budget-sheet-negative` were added to `Categories.stories.tsx` for these pairs (no existing story leaves the
  sheet open), and `APP_GETS` has Ocio's own movements as the app asks for them.
- **Análisis (`insights-insights--*`).** The page is as long as its three cards (about 2130px), and a pair
  compares the viewport only, so the stories that look at a card below the fold scroll the page to it
  (`TrendScrolled`, `TrendYearScrolled`, `TrendGapsScrolled` and `CostOfLivingScrolled` were added to
  `Insights.stories.tsx`; the card starts 16px under the top, or as near as the page's end lets it). The app test
  scrolls the app's own page to the same offset (`position.jumpTo`, or as far as it goes), so the gradient in those
  pictures is the one a phone shows.
  - The charts are Recharts on the web and a `CustomPainter` in the app (`lib/insights/chart_geometry.dart` is a port of
    what Recharts computes). `pnpm --filter @lukas/web parity:insights-geometry` reads what the web draws for the
    insights stories (sector paths, bars, grid, axis names, the budget line) into
    `apps/mobile/test/insights/recharts_geometry.json`, which `chart_geometry_test.dart` checks the port against, with the
    stories' own data.
  - Recharts leaves out the month names that would touch, measuring them in a hidden span under the `body` (Nunito
    11px at weight 700) while the names are drawn at 800: the app measures the same way (`measureTickName`).
  - Recharts keeps a bar out of the picture when it has no height; the stories' counts of bars are of the months
    that have data.
- **Stories that are not pictures of the component.** A few stories' end states are not what the
  component draws on its own:
  - `ui-toast--*`: Playwright takes the picture with CSS animations at their end, so the time bar is
    gone and the toast is still there. The app's host here lives for an hour (`dismissAfter`) while its
    bar runs its real eight seconds.
  - `ui-bottombar--*`: the web has no 🎤, so the pairs hide it (`showMic: false`);
    `test/ui/bottom_bar_golden_test.dart` has its own pictures of the bar with the 🎤, to review by eye.
  - `ui-namefield--two-rows-at-most` has no pair: `useRowLimit` measures before the fonts have loaded,
    so the story shows six shortcuts where the fonts' widths show seven.
  - A story's click leaves the focus on what it clicked, which Chrome rings; `act:` presses Tab to the
    same control.
- **Pictures are the Mac's.** Text and shadows rasterise differently on Linux. The parity goldens
  are tagged `golden`, so CI skips them (`dart_test.yaml`), as it skips the other goldens.
